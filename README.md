# ML-PROJECT-
Predicting and plotting the actual vs predicted stalk


# 📘 Installation Guide for ML-PROJECT-

## 🔧 Prerequisites
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher  
- **pip**: Latest version recommended  
- **Git**: For cloning the repository  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To run `.ipynb` files  

Optional but recommended:
- **Virtual environment** (e.g., `venv` or `conda`) to isolate dependencies.

## 📂 Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivansh31414/ML-PROJECT-.git
cd ML-PROJECT-
```

---

## 📦 Step 2: Set Up Virtual Environment
Using `venv`:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows
```

Using `conda`:
```bash
conda create -n mlproject python=3.9
conda activate mlproject
```

---

## 📑 Step 3: Install Dependencies
Since the repo doesn’t list dependencies yet, here’s a starter set based on typical ML workflows:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
```

👉 If you add a `requirements.txt` later, users can install everything with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Step 4: Run the Notebook
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open `Untitled13.ipynb` and run the cells to:
- Train the model  
- Predict stalk values  
- Plot actual vs predicted results  

---

## 🧪 Step 5: Verify Installation
- Ensure plots are generated without errors.  
- Confirm predictions align with expected outputs.
